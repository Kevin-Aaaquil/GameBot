# GameBot

This is a Discord Bot coded in Javascript, which uses Node.js and MongoDB. It talks to your discord server and responds to commands using the prefix `*`, for example `*help`. 

To host a bot like this you would need to create a `.env` file. In that `.env` file you would need to add a mongodb URL. This URL must contain the username and password of your mongodb cluster, it should also end with `/TruthAndDareBot`. When making a database in Atlas, the programmer needs to ensure that both the database name and collection name is `TruthAndDareBot`

You would also need to create a `config.json` file and store your bot token in that file using the variable name `token`. It should be in the below given format. **DO NOT** share this token with anyone else to avoid tampering with your bot.

{

{
 
    "prefix" : "!"

    "token" : "Your Bot Token Must Be Entered Here"

}

}

## This BOT is currently in BETA mode and new features will be added
